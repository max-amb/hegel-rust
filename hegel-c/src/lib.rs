/// - `HEGEL_STATISTICS`: anything but `0` turns `show_statistics` on.
/// - `HEGEL_SEED`: an integer fixes the seed; `none` clears one.
/// - `HEGEL_DERANDOMIZE` and `HEGEL_PRINT_BLOB`: `true`, `1` or `yes`, or
///   `false`, `0` or `no`.

/// answers true unconditionally for a flagged invariant and samples the
/// rest. Group ids are arbitrary
/// (any value except `HEGEL_STATE_MACHINE_DONE`, which
/// `hegel_state_machine_next_group` reserves as its termination sentinel):
/// the machine has one concurrency group per distinct value of
/// `rule_groups`. The engine draws the machine's concurrency
/// level — the number of workers (typically worker threads) that will pull
/// rules — in `[min_concurrency, max_concurrency]` and writes it into
/// `*out_concurrency`; the caller must run exactly that many workers. The
/// engine owns the distribution, which is weighted toward
/// `max_concurrency` (concurrency bugs need concurrency) rather than
/// shrink-biased toward the minimum. Pass `min_concurrency ==
/// max_concurrency` to fix the level without consuming entropy — `1, 1`
/// for a sequential machine. `step_count` is the target number of counted
/// rounds the machine runs per test case: every case runs at least one
/// round and at most `step_count` (at concurrency 1, where a round is one
/// rule, that is at most `step_count` completed rules), and each sampled
/// invariant is checked with probability `1 / step_count` per join point.
/// The engine has no default; frontends typically use 50.
///
/// The engine owns rule selection — including swarm testing, where each
/// worker enables a random subset of rules (at least one per group) and
/// selection draws only from that subset, with probability proportional
/// to `rule_weights` among the enabled rules of the current group. A
/// rule's realized frequency therefore depends on which other rules its
/// worker has enabled: the weights are a guide, not a guarantee. The
/// caller drives execution in
/// rounds: on the root test-case handle it asks
/// `hegel_state_machine_next_group` whether another round should run, then
/// each worker asks `hegel_state_machine_next_rule` which rule to run and
/// applies it, until that call signals the join point. Rules in
/// the same group may run concurrently; rules in different groups never
/// overlap.
///
/// Creating the machine draws from the calling handle's stream: the
/// concurrency level and each worker's swarm parameters are decided here,
/// up front, so the machine is fully constructed before any rule is
/// requested.
///
/// Creating a machine with `max_concurrency > 1` declares the run
/// nondeterministic: thread scheduling is outside the engine's control, so
/// nothing that assumes deterministic replay can be trusted. On a run not
/// already known to be nondeterministic, the first such creation is
/// rejected with `HEGEL_E_ASSUME` — the caller should abandon the body and
/// report the case `HEGEL_STATUS_INVALID`, exactly as for a failed
/// assumption — and the engine flips the run at that case's end. Every
/// later test case is marked nondeterministic before it starts (so a
/// frontend can capture its whole trace for the failure report, including
/// draws made before the machine is created) and its creations succeed.
/// From the flip on, the run reports failures faithfully from the
/// discovering execution and skips data-tree recording (and with it
/// novel-prefix generation and the nondeterminism mismatch check), span
/// mutation, the verify and shrink pass (and with it the flakiness check —
/// generation stops at the first bug, so at most one failure is reported),
/// targeting, and database persistence and reuse. Failures from such a run
/// carry no reproduce blob. A notice explaining this is printed once, on
/// the run's output, unless verbosity is quiet. This applies even to test
/// cases whose drawn concurrency level is 1: the declared bound is what
/// counts. Standalone test cases — `hegel_test_case_from_blob` replays —
/// are never rejected.
///
/// On success writes a caller-owned handle into `*out_state_machine` —
/// pass it to subsequent `hegel_state_machine_next_group` /
/// `hegel_state_machine_next_rule` / `hegel_state_machine_rule_rejected`
/// calls (through any handle of the same test-case family) and release it
/// with `hegel_state_machine_free` exactly once — writes the drawn
